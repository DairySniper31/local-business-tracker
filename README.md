Local Business tracker showcases businesses that are in the user's current area. The application will highlight people of color owned businesses and businesses that were hurt during Covid-19, using categories such as grocery, entertainment, clothing, and services. Users will be able to employ our minimalist application to search their local area and give ratings on how well the establishment adheres to Covid-19 practices. Business owners will be able to list their establishments and address customer ratings.
